# Problem: Check how old you are on 5 May 2022

# Input: day of birthday as an integer from 1 to 31
day = input("day of birthday as an integer from 1 to 31: ")
# Input: month of birthday as an integer from 1 to 12
month = input("month of birthday as an integer from 1 to 12: ")

# Calculate age based only on year

age = 2022 - year

# Adjust for month

if month > 5 :

if month == 5 and day <= 5:  # added column

    age = age - 1

print('On 5 May 2022 I am ' , age , 'years old') # added second single quote
